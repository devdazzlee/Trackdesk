# Authentication System Fix

## Problem

The original `lib/auth.ts` file was importing server-side Next.js functions (`cookies` and `redirect`) which caused an error when used in client components:

```
You're importing a component that needs "next/headers". That only works in a Server Component which is not supported in the pages/ directory.
```

## Solution

Split the authentication utilities into separate client and server-side files:

### File Structure

- `lib/auth.ts` - Main export file that re-exports from both client and server files
- `lib/auth-client.ts` - Client-side authentication utilities (browser only)
- `lib/auth-server.ts` - Server-side authentication utilities (Next.js server components only)

### Changes Made

1. **Created `lib/auth-client.ts`**:

   - Contains all client-side authentication logic
   - `AuthClient` class for browser-based authentication
   - Cookie management utilities
   - API calls for login, register, logout
   - Utility functions (`isAdmin`, `isAffiliate`, `getFullName`, `getInitials`)

2. **Created `lib/auth-server.ts`**:

   - Contains server-side authentication utilities
   - Functions that use `cookies()` and `redirect()` from Next.js
   - `getServerUser()`, `getServerToken()`, `requireAuth()`, `requireRole()`

3. **Updated `lib/auth.ts`**:

   - Now only re-exports from client and server files
   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - No direct imports of server-side functions

4. **Updated imports**:
   - `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` now imports from `auth-client.ts`
   - `app/dashboard/page.tsx` now imports from `auth-client.ts`
   - Server components can import from `auth-server.ts` or `auth.ts`

### Usage Examples

#### Client Components

```typescript
// ✅ Works in client components
import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";
import { isAdmin, getFullName } from "@/lib/auth-client";
```

#### Server Components

```typescript
// ✅ Works in server components
import { requireAuth, getServerUser } from "@/lib/auth-server";
// or
import { requireAuth, getServerUser } from "@/lib/auth";
```

#### Mixed Usage

```typescript
// ✅ Works in both client and server
import { User, AuthResponse } from "@/lib/auth";
```

### Test Pages Added

- `/test-auth` - Client-side authentication test page
- `/test-server-auth` - Server-side authentication test page

These pages are excluded from authentication requirements in the middleware and can be used to verify the authentication system works correctly.

## Benefits

1. **Fixes the import error** - No more server-side imports in client components
2. **Maintains compatibility** - Existing code continues to work
3. **Clear separation** - Client vs server utilities are clearly separated
4. **Type safety** - TypeScript can properly infer which functions work where
5. **Better performance** - Only necessary code is loaded for each environment

## Testing

1. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Visit test pages:
   - `http://localhost:3000/test-auth` - Test client-side auth
   - `http://localhost:3000/test-server-auth` - Test server-side auth
4. Test authentication flow:
   - Login/register at `/auth/login` or `/auth/register`
   - Verify cookies are set and user data is available
   - Test logout functionality
   - Verify protected routes redirect properly
