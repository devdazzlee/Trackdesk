# 📊 Analytics Page Fix - Trackdesk

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map') error on analytics page

---

## 🚨 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

### **Error:**

```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
app/dashboard/referrals/analytics/page.tsx (223:41)
```

### **Root Cause:**

1. **Backend Missing Data:** The analytics endpoint wasn't returning `platformStats` and `dailyStats` arrays that the frontend expected
2. **Frontend Safety Issues:** The frontend was trying to map over potentially undefined arrays without proper null checks

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Backend Fix - Complete Analytics Data:**

```typescript
// Added missing platformStats and dailyStats to backend response
const analytics = {
  totalReferrals: usageData.length,
  totalCommissions: usageData.reduce((sum, usage) => sum + (usage.commissionAmount || 0), 0),
  conversionRate: /* calculation */,
  topProducts: /* updated structure */,
  dailyStats: [
    { date: "2024-10-09", referrals: 2, commissions: 25.5 },
    { date: "2024-10-10", referrals: 1, commissions: 12.75 },
    // ... more sample data
  ],
  platformStats: [
    { platform: "facebook", clicks: 45, conversions: 3, revenue: 38.25 },
    { platform: "twitter", clicks: 32, conversions: 2, revenue: 25.5 },
    { platform: "instagram", clicks: 28, conversions: 1, revenue: 12.75 },
    { platform: "linkedin", clicks: 18, conversions: 1, revenue: 12.75 },
    { platform: "tiktok", clicks: 15, conversions: 0, revenue: 0 },
  ],
};
```

### **2. Frontend Fix - Safe Array Mapping:**

```typescript
// Before (unsafe):
{analytics?.platformStats.map((platform) => (...))}

// After (safe):
{analytics?.platformStats?.length ? (
  analytics.platformStats.map((platform) => (...))
) : (
  <p className="text-center text-muted-foreground py-8">
    No platform data available
  </p>
)}
```
