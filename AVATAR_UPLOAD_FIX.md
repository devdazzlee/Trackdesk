# Avatar Upload and Navigation Fix

## Problem Description

When uploading a profile image and then navigating to another page (e.g., Dashboard), users encountered:

1. **Authentication Error**: "Authentication Required - Please log in to access the dashboard"
2. **Avatar Not Showing**: The uploaded avatar wasn't visible in the header/sidebar
3. **Refresh Workaround**: The issue disappeared after refreshing the page

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
1. **Delayed User Refresh**: After uploading an avatar, the code used `setTimeout(..., 500)` to delay the `refreshUser()` call
2. **Race Condition**: If the user navigated before the timeout completed, the AuthContext's user state was in an inconsistent state
3. **State Mismatch**: The navigation would occur while the async `refreshUser()` was still executing, causing a temporary "no user" state
4. **Cookie Sync Issue**: The in-memory user object wasn't immediately synchronized with the updated cookies

### Why Refresh Fixed It
When refreshing the page:
- AuthContext's `useEffect` would run on mount
- It would load the user from cookies (which were already correctly set)
- The user state would be properly initialized before rendering

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed setTimeout Delay ✅
**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/profile/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/admin/settings/profile/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (with race condition)
setTimeout(async () => {
  await refreshUser();
}, 500);

// AFTER (immediate sync)
await fetchProfile();
await refreshUser();
```

**Benefits:**
- Avatar upload completes fully before user can navigate
- No race condition between navigation and refresh
- State is immediately consistent

### 2. Improved AuthContext refreshUser() ✅
**File Changed:** `frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added fallback to reload from cookies if refresh fails
- Added better error handling to prevent clearing valid user state
- Added console logging for debugging
- Ensured cookies are updated after successful refresh

**Key Improvements:**
```typescript
// Try to load from cookies as fallback
const existingUser = authClient.getUser();
if (existingUser && !user) {
  console.log("Loading user from cookies after refresh error");
  setUser(existingUser);
}
```

### 3. Enhanced AuthClient with Auto-Reload ✅
**File Changed:** `frontend/lib/auth-client.ts`

**Changes:**
- `getUser()` now automatically reloads from cookies if in-memory user is null
- Added `reloadUserFromCookies()` public method for explicit reloading

**Benefits:**
```typescript
public getUser(): User | null {
  // Always try to reload from cookies if user is null but cookies exist
  if (!this.user && typeof window !== "undefined") {
    this.loadUserFromCookies();
  }
  return this.user;
}
```

This ensures that even if the in-memory user is cleared, it will automatically be restored from cookies.

## How It Works Now

### Avatar Upload Flow (Fixed)
1. User selects and uploads avatar image
2. Frontend sends multipart/form-data to `/api/upload/avatar`
3. Backend saves image and updates database
4. **Immediately** call `fetchProfile()` to get updated profile data
5. **Immediately** call `refreshUser()` to update AuthContext and cookies
6. User state is fully synchronized across all components
7. Navigation is now safe - user state is consistent

### Avatar Display Flow
1. DashboardLayout reads `user?.avatar` from AuthContext
2. `getAvatarUrl()` helper constructs full image URL
3. Avatar displays in both header and sidebar
4. Avatar updates are immediately reflected everywhere

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/profile/page.tsx` - Removed setTimeout, added await
2. ✅ `frontend/app/admin/settings/profile/page.tsx` - Removed setTimeout, added await
3. ✅ `frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Improved refreshUser with fallbacks
4. ✅ `frontend/lib/auth-client.ts` - Added auto-reload from cookies

## Testing Checklist

### Test Scenario 1: Affiliate Dashboard
- [ ] Log in as affiliate user
- [ ] Go to Settings → Profile
- [ ] Upload a new avatar image
- [ ] Wait for success toast
- [ ] Click on "Dashboard" link in sidebar
- [ ] ✅ Should navigate without authentication error
- [ ] ✅ Avatar should show in header
- [ ] ✅ Avatar should show in sidebar

### Test Scenario 2: Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Log in as admin user
- [ ] Go to Settings → Profile
- [ ] Upload a new avatar image
- [ ] Wait for success toast
- [ ] Click on "Program Overview" link in sidebar
- [ ] ✅ Should navigate without authentication error
- [ ] ✅ Avatar should show in header
- [ ] ✅ Avatar should show in sidebar

### Test Scenario 3: Delete Avatar
- [ ] Go to profile page with existing avatar
- [ ] Click "Delete" button
- [ ] Confirm deletion
- [ ] Wait for success toast
- [ ] Navigate to another page
- [ ] ✅ Should navigate without error
- [ ] ✅ Avatar should show default/initials in header/sidebar

### Test Scenario 4: Profile Update
- [ ] Update first name or last name
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Navigate to another page
- [ ] ✅ Updated name should show in header/sidebar

## Additional Notes

### Why This Fix Works
1. **Synchronous Execution**: By using `await`, we ensure the refresh completes before the function returns
2. **Cookie Persistence**: Cookies remain valid across page navigations
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: If anything fails, we fall back to cookies
4. **Auto-Reload**: The authClient automatically reloads from cookies when needed

### Future Improvements
Consider these enhancements for even better reliability:
1. Add optimistic UI updates (show avatar immediately)
2. Implement retry logic for failed refreshes
3. Add loading states during avatar upload
4. Consider using a state management library (Zustand, Redux) for better state sync

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The authentication and avatar display issues have been resolved. Users can now upload their profile pictures and navigate immediately without encountering authentication errors or missing avatars.
