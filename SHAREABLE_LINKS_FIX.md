# 🔗 Shareable Links Fix - Trackdesk

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Shareable Links showing old referral code instead of newly created one

---

## 🚨 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

### **Issue:**

- User created new referral code: `AFF_GJZPV9`
- Shareable Links page still showing old code: `DEMO_BOTH_001`
- Links not updating to reflect the latest referral code

### **Root Cause:**

The `generateShareableLinks` function in the backend was using `findFirst()` without ordering, which returned the first referral code found (the old one) instead of the most recent one.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Backend Fix - Get Most Recent Code:**

```typescript
// Before (returns first code found):
let generalCode = await prisma.referralCode.findFirst({
  where: {
    affiliateId,
    type: "BOTH",
    isActive: true,
  },
});

// After (returns most recent code):
let generalCode = await prisma.referralCode.findFirst({
  where: {
    affiliateId,
    type: "BOTH",
    isActive: true,
  },
  orderBy: {
    createdAt: "desc", // Get the most recently created code
  },
});
```

### **2. Frontend Fix - Added Refresh Button:**

```typescript
// Added refresh functionality
const [isRefreshing, setIsRefreshing] = useState(false);

const fetchShareableLinks = async (isRefresh = false) => {
  if (isRefresh) {
    setIsRefreshing(true);
  }
  // ... fetch logic with success notification
};

// Added refresh button to header
<Button
  variant="outline"
  onClick={() => fetchShareableLinks(true)}
  disabled={isRefreshing}
  className="flex items-center gap-2"
>
  <RefreshCw className={`w-4 h-4 ${isRefreshing ? "animate-spin" : ""}`} />
  {isRefreshing ? "Refreshing..." : "Refresh Links"}
</Button>;
```

## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS NOW**

3. **Links Generated:** All shareable links use `AFF_GJZPV9`
4. **User Sees:** Updated links immediately

### **Manual Refresh:**

1. **Click Refresh Button:** User clicks "Refresh Links"
2. **API Call:** Fetches latest referral codes from backend
3. **Links Updated:** Shows links with newest referral code
4. **Success Notification:** "Links refreshed successfully!"
